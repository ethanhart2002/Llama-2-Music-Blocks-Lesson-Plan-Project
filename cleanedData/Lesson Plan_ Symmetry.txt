Music Blocks Lesson Plan Symmetry Age 712 years Lesson duration 60 minutes Introduction What is symmetry 15m Part 1 Invert 15m Break 5m Part 2 Retrograde 15m PerformanceCritique 10m Number of students Up to 10 Rationale Students will learn about symmetry and how it is commonly used in music Objectives Students will explore the Click event handler and different ways to explore that mechanism in building interactivity into Music Blocks applications LESSON Introduction What is symmetry Begin by asking students to sit in a circle and explain that in todays lesson they are going to explore symmetry Start off by having each student describe what they think symmetry is What are some examples of symmetry in the real world Using paper and pencil make a pattern Place a mirror up to the drawing and explore the symmetry of the reflected image Try drawing a symmetric pattern without the mirror Next explore a symmetry paint program written in Music Blocks httpsmusicblockssugarlabsorgid1523389168734406 Discuss how symmetry might work in music What if your left and right hands on a piano were to play in symmetry In Music Blocks well use the Invert block and the Backward block to create two different types of symmetry Part 1 Invert Create a theme inside an Action block Play the theme from a Start block Using an Invert block from the Pitch palette listen to what happens when your theme is inverted Using an Oneverynotedo Block trigger an action to draw the notes as they play If you change colors in between the symmetry is easier to see Discuss what is going on musically Explore using different values in the Invert block Break Part 2 Retrograde Retrograde is a fancy way of saying backwards Playing your music backwards is another kind of symmetry which is common in music Play Bachs Crab Canon as an example httpsmusicblockssugarlabsorgindexhtmlid1522885323588493 From the Flow palette get a Backward block Use the Backward block in place of your Invert block Note that the Backward block will only play the outermost blocks backwards Explore different combinations of Backward and Invert Have fun PerformanceCritique 1 Have each student play their compositions and then talk about what role symmetry plays 2 Engage in a discussion about more things that they could do with symmetry Key events Introduction of key concept symmetry There is more than one type of symmetry The students create their own variations on what it means to use symmetry Materials Music Blocks software Paper pencil and mirror optional Assessment Observe participation Do the programs make use of the concept of symmetry Is there a creative use of symmetry Copyright Walter Bender 2020
