Music Blocks Lesson Plan Conditionals Age 712 years Lesson duration 90 minutes Introduction Simon Says 10m Part 1 IfThen 20m Break 5m Part 2 Scalar Step 20m Break 5m Part 3 Explorations 20m PerformanceCritique 10m Number of students Up to 10 Rationale Students will learn about the computational concept of a conditional and explore it within the musical concept of a scalar step Objectives Students will learn about a fundamental tool in computation the conditional Students will be able to utilize the conditional in the creation of interactive compositions LESSON Introduction Begin by asking students to sit in a circle and explain that in todays lesson they are going to learn about the concept of a conditional if this is true then do that Start by choosing one student to be the leader Have them play Simon in a game of Simon Says Repeat the exercise but now have the students clap whenever Simon doesnt say Discuss what is going on Wen Simon says do something When Simon doesnt say dont do anything or do something else Part 1 IfThenElse 1 Ask the students to drag the IfThenElse block from the Flow Palette 2 Have them guess what it might do 3 Have them drag the Mouse Button block from the Sensor Palette 4 Have them guess what it might do 5 Have them put two different Note blocks inside the IfThenElse block and attach the Mouse Button Block to the if slot 6 Place the IfThenElse block inside of a Forever Block 7 Explore and make observations Break Part 2 A Scalar Step 1 Sing or play a sequence of notes Do Re Mi or Mi Re Do 2 Ask the students if you are going up or down in the scale 3 Repeat until they can explain the idea of going up or down 4 Mix it up and have the students indicate when you are going up or down B Scalar Step Block 1 Drag two Scalar Step blocks from the Pitch Palette 2 Replace the pitches inside the Note Blocks in the program created in Part 1 with the Scalar Step Blocks 3 Change the argument to one of the Scalar Step blocks to 1 4 Add a starting Note Block before the Forever block 5 Explore and observe Break Part 3 Explorations 1 Add other blocks to the conditional and see what happens Try changing volume tempo etc Some students may want to explore other conditionals using the Boolean blocks and other sensors such as Cursor x and Cursor Y PerformanceCritique 1 Have each student perform their composition 2 Engage in a discussion about conditionals How else can you use them What are some other conditions than Mouse Button that might be fun to incorporate Key events Introduction of key concepts lead and follow The use of action blocks to share code melody The use of the rest to create a delay The use of transpositions to make changes that remain familiar Materials Music Blocks software Assessment Observe participation Examine the code Do the students use conditionals Do the students use scalar step Copyright Walter Bender 2020
