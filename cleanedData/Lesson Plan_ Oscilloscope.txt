Music Blocks Lesson Plan Oscilloscope Age 712 years Lesson duration 60 minutes Introduction What is an oscilloscope 15m Part 1 Exploring different instruments 15m Break 5m Part 2 Exploring different notes 20m Discussion 5m Number of students Up to 10 Rationale Students will explore the Oscilloscope Widget in order to get insight into the relationship between frequency and pitch Objectives Students will understand the connection between waves and sound as well as the different waveforms sine triangle sine etc LESSON Introduction Begin by asking students to sit in a circle and explain that in todays lesson they are going to use the Oscilloscope Widget Begin by discussing waves Where have you seen a wave Can you describe a wave Does it have peaks and troughs Does it move Is it symmetric Does it have texture How else are waves similar or different Where does a wave come from Where else might there be waves Sound travels in waves through the air How can we see them An oscilloscope is a device that displays a twodimensional plot of one or more signals as a function of time The Oscilloscope Widget shows time on the horizontal axis and amplitude of the wave on the vertical axis Part 1 When you increase pitch by octave the frequency doubles How does the shape of the waveform change as the octave changes Can you guess the octave based on the shape of the plot Part 2 Variations of A in Octave 4 440Hz Different instruments and synths create waves of different shapes Can you tell which instrument is playing based on the shape of the plot PerformanceCritique 1 Have each student explore some musical ideas while the Oscilloscope Widget is opened 2 Engage in a discussion about what they see How is a flute different from a violin Are string instruments similar What about drums And of course check out the duck synth 3 How else can we represent the shape of the sounds we hear Key events Introduction of key concepts the oscilloscope plotting amplitude over time Materials Music Blocks software Assessment Observe participation Are the students able to distinguish between different pitches and timbres by looking at the waveform Copyright Walter Bender 2020
