Music Blocks Lesson Plan Picture Hunt Age 712 years Lesson duration 60 minutes Introduction More applications distance 15m Part 1 Describing location 20m Break 5m Part 2 Interacting with location 15m PerformanceCritique 10m Number of students Up to 10 Rationale Students will learn more about using coordinate systems to build interactive environments Objectives Students will understand how to use the cartesian coordinates to trigger different effects in an interactive setting LESSON Introduction Begin by asking students to sit in a circle and explain that in todays lesson they are going to learn more about gaming software Start off by recalling What is distance Remind them that the Distance block can measure the distance between two points or two mice Then explain that the goal of todays activity is to measure the distance from different locations on the screen If the mouse gets close to a location some action is taken Discuss how X and Y positions are used in Music Blocks a coordinate grid If the students need reminding show the coordinate grid and explore with them how it works Part 1 Describing Location Have the students use the Show block to load an image onto the screen The image will serve as the backdrop for their activities Note that the Height block is used to set the size of the picture which is taller than it is wide fills the entire height of the screen If a picture is wider than it is tall try using the Width block instead Now that there is a background picture on the screen we need to find the xy coordinates of points of interest on the picture One way to do this is to use the mouse to point to different parts of the image The Status widget can be used to show the coordinates as the mouse moves Write down in a table the coordinates of a point of interest for example the nose on each face Well use these coordinates in our game Break Part 2 Interacting with Location Write a program that continuously moves the mouse around the screen Now well use the Distance block to determine if we are near one of the points of interest If 50 is greater than the distance to the womans nose then do the Action called womans nose Note that we use the coordinates that we recorded earlier in our table Note Since the theme music may be played only sporadically you may need to use a No Clock block as a wrapper around your music Similarly we can write a test for the mans nose using the coordinates from the table PerformanceCritique 1 Have each student show their game 2 Engage in a discussion about their different approaches Key events Introduction of key concepts distance cartesian coordinates conditionals The students create their own interactive games and narratives Materials Music Blocks software Background images downloaded from the internet Assessment Observe participation Does the program perform as expected Is the Distance block used appropriately Are grid coordinates used appropriately Copyright Walter Bender 2020
